# Security Policy

Home automation is not a joke. Please consider all dangers involving the use of this repository to control your home or building.
A single light that remains ON while you're not at home, for example, can become a serious danger for fire.<br/>
All unattended devices put your building at risk.<br/>
Not to mention if, for your fault or for a BUG in the knx-ultimate repository, a garage doors closes while a child is sitting inbetween.
The **building security** must be your primary concern.<br/>
Please use knx-ultimate (but it's generally the same for ALL repositories) only to control actuators that have been secured by other certified means.<br/>
For the example above, the garage door must be secured by a **CERTIFIED mechanical or electronical system**, preventing damages to people, animals or things.
The developer of knx-ultimate repository and all developers involved in this project, is not responsible in any way for any damage, as stated in the MIT License you can find [here](https://github.com/Supergiovane/node-red-contrib-knx-ultimate/blob/master/LICENSE).<br/>


## Home automation rules

In my experience, i developed some **best practices** to secure my home from fire, damages and risks for third persons.<br/>

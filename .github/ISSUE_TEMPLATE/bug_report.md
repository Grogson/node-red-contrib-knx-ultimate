**Courtesy is a must**
Some people still asking feature requests, help and other things, without even a salutation.
I've developed the nodes for free and you're using it for free and you're receiving professional level support in no time. I don't want you to thank me for my work, but a salutation like "Hello Supergiovane" should be the first line you write. Courtesy is "a must" here in Italy, so please be kind. Kindness is free :-)
